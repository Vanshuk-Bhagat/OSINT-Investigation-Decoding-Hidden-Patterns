# OSINT-Investigation-Decoding-Hidden-Patterns
This project demonstrates the application of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to investigate and analyze suspicious online activity. Using a combination of powerful OSINT tools and manual analysis, I decoded hidden patterns and extracted valuable insights.

Key Highlights:
Utilized tools like Maltego, SpiderFoot, CyberChef, and OpenStego to gather and analyze data.
Decoded an encrypted Google Drive link through a multi-step process, involving Base85 conversion and Caesar cipher decoding.
Reconstructed hidden messages and investigated social media profiles to uncover potential clues.
Documented every step, including tool usage, findings, challenges, and conclusions, in a detailed and professional report.
Skills Demonstrated:

Cryptographic analysis and decoding techniques.
Effective use of OSINT tools for data gathering and pattern recognition.
Critical thinking and problem-solving in cybersecurity investigations.
This project highlights my ability to apply OSINT methodologies in real-world scenarios and document findings comprehensively for actionable insights.
